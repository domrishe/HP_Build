This site is a public build log for a Hangprinter v4 built for the RISD sculpture class Open Hardware. More info on Hangprinter can be found at [hangprinter.org](https://hangprinter.org/)

Hangprinter is a 3d printer that evolved out of the RepRap project and aims to allow much larger cost-adjusted build volume by eliminating the traditional printer fram with cables and anchors that can be placed anywhere.

 I'll be building the Hangprinter v4 and modifying the printhead in some way to be able to print large and fast, either by making a high-flow nozzle and printing expanding PLA, or potentially just triggering a can of expanding insulation foam.


Here's a look at the overall design. Instead of the usual extrusions, linear rails, etc. the printer operates on a systtem of cables in a tetrahedron arrangement.s
