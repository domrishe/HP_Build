### October 28
# [](#header-3) Site deployed, prints started, most of BOM ordered.

- Website has been deployed
    - Using Jekyll theme "Just the Docs"
- Prints started
    - ![Failed parts](/assets/images/parts.png)
      Sliced a bunch of parts as a test to check on orientation/prints setting, etc, and it stopped halfway through the 20-hr print. Not sure why. Also go some questionable print quality on a few of the parts. 
- Most of BOM ordered
    - Might be useful to put a page together with pics of the parts to help future builders with ordering
