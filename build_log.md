# [](#header-1) Build Notes
### Updates posted periodically. Build started October 2022.
The documentation for Hangprinter v4 is a bit sparse, but ultimately contains what you need to get the job done. Check out the link in the upper right to the official Hangprinter website, where you'll find links to all the relevant repos and a page with details on the build and calibration process. There's also a link in the upper right to my copy of the BOM, with links to where I bought from.

### Print big at low cost

### 2022.10.28
### Site deployed, prints started, most of BOM ordered.

- Website has been deployed
    - Using Jekyll theme "Just the Docs"
- Prints started
    - ![Failed parts](/assets/images/parts.png)
      Sliced a bunch of parts as a test to check on orientation/prints setting, etc, and it stopped halfway through the 20-hr print. Not sure why. Also go some questionable print quality on a few of the parts. 
- Most of BOM ordered
    - Might be useful to put a page together with pics of the parts to help future builders with ordering
