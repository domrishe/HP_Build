# [](#header-1) Hotend Modification
I was generously gifted an old hotend from a Lulzbot TAZ 6, and decided to use it for the HP4. Lulzbot uses a nice french cleat system as common mounting point for a variety of hotends, and I thought incorporating this might add some modularity to the design and be a relatively easy lift. 


### CAD
Here's the embedded CAD for the modified cleat. It simply does away with the Lulzbot linear rail guides and the mounting holes for the bushings, and replaces them with a small bracket to screw right into my wooden chassis. There may be a more permanent solution, but this should work for now.
