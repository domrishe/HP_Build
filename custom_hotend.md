# [](#header-1) Hotend Modification
I was generously gifted an old hotend from a Lulzbot TAZ 6, and decided to use it for the HP4. Lulzbot uses a nice french cleat system as common mounting point for a variety of hotends, and I thought incorporating this might add some modularity to the design and be a relatively easy lift. 


### CAD
Here's the embedded CAD for the modified cleat. It simply does away with the Lulzbot linear rail guides and the mounting holes for the bushings, and replaces them with a small bracket to screw right into my wooden chassis. There may be a more permanent solution, but this should work for now.

### TAZ 6
This is the TAZ 6 extruder from Lulzbot. I plan to bore out an old nozzle to around 1.5mm to increase the flowrate.

### Next steps
The genesis of this project was to be able to print large things fast, and I'm planning to creep up on that goal incrementally. The first step is using the above extruder with a bored out nozzle in conjunction with a lightweight, expanding PLA which increases its volume depending on temperature and extrusion flowrate. I've done some preliminary tests to dial in the specs and the results are pretty interesting.

### Pellet extruder
The next step up from this might be the use of a pellet extruder. The hangprinter has alread proven capable of carrying a heavier large-scale clay extruder, and this would allow much larger and faster printing at low resolutions. Knowledge gained from using the LW-PLA at a smaller scale could also be utilized, as the material is also available as pellets.
